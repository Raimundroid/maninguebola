/* ============================================
   RESPONSIVE NAVIGATION STYLES
   ============================================

   This stylesheet provides a mobile-first responsive design
   for the navigation bar component using Bootstrap's 6 breakpoints.

   INCLUDES CSS-BASED ICONS (No icon library needed!)

   MOBILE-FIRST APPROACH:
   Base styles are designed for mobile devices first (xs: < 576px)
   Then enhanced for larger screens using min-width media queries

   BOOTSTRAP 6 BREAKPOINTS:
   - xs: < 576px    (Extra small - phones in portrait)
   - sm: ≥ 576px    (Small - phones in landscape)
   - md: ≥ 768px    (Medium - tablets)
   - lg: ≥ 992px    (Large - desktops)
   - xl: ≥ 1200px   (Extra large - large desktops)
   - xxl: ≥ 1400px  (Extra extra large - larger desktops)

   :root selector targets the HTML document root
   These variables define the light theme colors
   They can be accessed anywhere in the CSS using var(--variable-name)

   BENEFITS:
   - Easy theme switching
   - Consistent colors throughout
   - Single source of truth for colors
   - Easy to maintain and update

   DARK THEME OVERRIDES
   ============================================

   When data-theme="dark" is set on the HTML element,
   these variables override the light theme colors

   HOW IT WORKS:
   JavaScript sets document.documentElement.setAttribute("data-theme", "dark")
   This makes all elements use these dark theme colors

  /* Very dark background */

  /* Slightly lighter background for cards */

 LINKS NOT CLICKABLE ON MOBILE TRUOBLESHOOTING
=============================================

/* FROM GOOGLE AI SEARCH MODE */

/* Since the previous suggestions didn't resolve the issue, the problem likely lies in the JavaScript logic that prevents body scrolling or a residual issue with z-index in a specific configuration that wasn't immediately apparent.
Here are further steps and potential fixes based on common mobile menu issues:*/

/*
1. The Body Scroll Prevention Issue
Your JavaScript uses document.body.style.overflow = "hidden"; to stop scrolling. This sometimes interacts poorly with fixed or sticky elements (like your navbar) on some mobile browsers, which might break the clickability of items within those elements.
Potential Fix: Use a CSS class for the body overflow instead of inline styles. */

/* In your JavaScript:
Modify the useEffect hook to add/remove a class from the body element instead of directly changing the style: */

/*javascript*/

/* useEffect(() => {
  if (isMenuOpen) {
    document.body.classList.add('no-scroll');
  } else {
    document.body.classList.remove('no-scroll');
  }
}, [isMenuOpen]); */

/* Use code with caution. */

/* In your Navbar.css:
Add this CSS rule: */

/* css */

/* .no-scroll {
  overflow: hidden;
  ** Optional: Add an alternative to prevent "jumping" when scrollbar disappears **
  padding-right: 15px;
} */
/* Use code with caution. */

/* 2. Z-Index Conflict (The "Click-Outside" Detector)
The handleClickOutside function uses document.querySelector(".navbar") to detect clicks. The issue might be that when the menu is open, the menu itself (.nav-links--active) is a child of the <nav class="navbar"> container. Clicking a link might be interpreted by the code as a click inside the navbar, but perhaps the event propagation is being stopped prematurely.
Potential Fix: Simplify click detection or increase Z-index on links.
Ensure your links have a high z-index relative to other page content: */

/* css */
/* In Navbar.css */

/* Ensure the active menu is clearly on top of everything else */
/* .nav-links--active {
  transform: translateX(0);
  z-index: 1001; ** Make sure this is higher than anything else **
} */

/* .navbar {
  ** ... existing styles ... **
  z-index: 1000; ** Main navbar container **
} */

/* Ensure links themselves are high enough */
/* .nav-link {
  ** ... existing styles ... **
  pointer-events: auto; ** Already suggested, but crucial **
  position: relative; ** Sometimes needed for z-index to work correctly **
  z-index: 1002; ** Even higher than the menu container **
} */

/* Use code with caution. */

/* 3. Debugging on Mobile
If you haven't already, use browser developer tools on a desktop and activate the mobile simulator (usually an icon in the top left of the dev tools panel). This is crucial for seeing exactly which element is receiving the click events using the "inspect element" feature.
If it's still not working, a different element you haven't shared (part of your main page content, or another component) might be positioned over the menu links when in the mobile view. The inspection tool will reveal what is at the top of the "stack" when you click. */

/* FROM CLAUDE AI */

/* Looking at the code, the issue is that on mobile, the navigation links are fixed positioned and cover the entire screen, but they're initially hidden off-screen with transform: translateX(-100%).
When you click a link, the mobile menu is still open and blocking interactions.
🔧 Solution: Add this to the CSS
Location: In the Navbar.css file, find the .nav-links section (around line 140-165) and add this property: */

/* css */
/* .nav-links {
 ** ... existing properties ... **

 ** ADD THIS LINE - ensures links are clickable even when menu is closing**
  pointer-events: auto;
} */

/* Better Solution: Update the media query
Actually, the real issue is that the mobile menu stays open after clicking. The handleNavClick() function should close it, but there might be a React state timing issue.
Location: In the JSX component, find the handleNavClick function (around line 110) and update it: */

/* jsx */
/**
 * handleNavClick: Called when a navigation link is clicked
 *
 * Purpose: Close the mobile menu after navigation
 * This ensures the menu doesn't stay open after the user selects a page
 *
 * MOBILE FIX: Added small delay to ensure navigation happens before closing
 */

/* const handleNavClick = () => {
  // Use setTimeout to ensure the navigation happens first
  // Then close the menu after a tiny delay
  setTimeout(() => {
    setIsMenuOpen(false); // Close mobile menu
  }, 100); // 100ms delay ensures smooth transition
}; */

/* Alternative Quick Fix (Recommended):
Location: In the CSS file, find .nav-links mobile section and ensure this is present: */

/* css */
/* Around line 140-165 in the .nav-links section */
/* .nav-links {
  ** ... existing code ... **

  ** MOBILE FIX: Ensure links are always clickable **
  pointer-events: auto;

  ** Also ensure z-index is high enough **
  z-index: 1001; ** Higher than navbar's z-index: 1000 **
} */

/* Try the setTimeout solution first - that's the cleanest fix! The links should work immediately after clicking. 🎯 */
