/* Since the previous suggestions didn't resolve the issue, the problem likely lies in the JavaScript logic that prevents body scrolling or a residual issue with z-index in a specific configuration that wasn't immediately apparent.
Here are further steps and potential fixes based on common mobile menu issues:*/

/*
1. The Body Scroll Prevention Issue
Your JavaScript uses document.body.style.overflow = "hidden"; to stop scrolling. This sometimes interacts poorly with fixed or sticky elements (like your navbar) on some mobile browsers, which might break the clickability of items within those elements.
Potential Fix: Use a CSS class for the body overflow instead of inline styles. */

/* In your JavaScript:
Modify the useEffect hook to add/remove a class from the body element instead of directly changing the style: */

/*javascript*/

/* useEffect(() => {
  if (isMenuOpen) {
    document.body.classList.add('no-scroll');
  } else {
    document.body.classList.remove('no-scroll');
  }
}, [isMenuOpen]); */

/* Use code with caution. */

/* In your Navbar.css:
Add this CSS rule: */

/* css */

/* .no-scroll {
  overflow: hidden;
  ** Optional: Add an alternative to prevent "jumping" when scrollbar disappears **
  padding-right: 15px;
} */
/* Use code with caution. */

/* 2. Z-Index Conflict (The "Click-Outside" Detector)
The handleClickOutside function uses document.querySelector(".navbar") to detect clicks. The issue might be that when the menu is open, the menu itself (.nav-links--active) is a child of the <nav class="navbar"> container. Clicking a link might be interpreted by the code as a click inside the navbar, but perhaps the event propagation is being stopped prematurely.
Potential Fix: Simplify click detection or increase Z-index on links.
Ensure your links have a high z-index relative to other page content: */

/* css */
/* In Navbar.css */

/* Ensure the active menu is clearly on top of everything else */
/* .nav-links--active {
  transform: translateX(0);
  z-index: 1001; ** Make sure this is higher than anything else **
} */

/* .navbar {
  ** ... existing styles ... **
  z-index: 1000; ** Main navbar container **
} */

/* Ensure links themselves are high enough */
/* .nav-link {
  ** ... existing styles ... **
  pointer-events: auto; ** Already suggested, but crucial **
  position: relative; ** Sometimes needed for z-index to work correctly **
  z-index: 1002; ** Even higher than the menu container **
} */

/* Use code with caution. */

/* 3. Debugging on Mobile
If you haven't already, use browser developer tools on a desktop and activate the mobile simulator (usually an icon in the top left of the dev tools panel). This is crucial for seeing exactly which element is receiving the click events using the "inspect element" feature.
If it's still not working, a different element you haven't shared (part of your main page content, or another component) might be positioned over the menu links when in the mobile view. The inspection tool will reveal what is at the top of the "stack" when you click. */
